My name is Faisal Mohammad. I am a machine learning engineer. Sometimes people mis-pronounce my name as 'fossil', therefore:

- I've accepted this is my life now
- I've only ever bought Fossil watches :(
- I named my Github page Fossil-AI

### Background

<!-- To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions. -->

I am currently employed as a machine learning engineer the Applied Physics Laboratory (@ Johns Hopkins University). Much of my work has been within the autonomous system domain. More specifically building, designing and deploying deep learning solutions for perception/robotics tasks in the maritime domain. I've worked with several modalities including: EO/IR, LWIR/MWIR, sonar, and hyperspectral imagery. Perception work includes a fair amount of automatic target recognition involving object detection and segmentation. Much of my integration and deployment development work is done via C++ while the data processing and model training side is done in Python. One major perk of working at APL is their part-time student program, consequently I made the decision to pursue a PhD on the side at UMBC. Before APL, I was an ML software engineer at Northrop Grumman working in target recognition on synthetic-aperature imagery (SAR).

### Frameworks

Software Languages: C/C#/C++, Python, and Java

ML Dev: Tensorflow (C++/Python), Pytorch (Python), Keras, OpenCV (C++/Python), ROS (C++/Python), NumPy, SciPy, HuggingFace, scikit-learn, TensorRT (C++/Python), Unity3D, probably other smaller scientific Python packages I had to pip install here and there.

ML Experience: Primarily deep learning in computer vision and natural language processing with some reinforcement learning sprinkled in there.

### Education
BA - Physics, Rutgers University - New Brunswick (2015)
M.S - Electrical & Computer Engineering, Rutgers University - New Brunswick (2017)
PhD - Computer Science, UMBC (2020 - Ongoing) (part-time)
