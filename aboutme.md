My name is Faisal Mohammad. I am a machine learning engineer. Sometimes people mis-pronounce my name as 'fossil', therefore:

- I've accepted this is my life now
- I've only ever bought Fossil watches :(
- I named my Github page Fossil-AI

### Background

<!-- To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions. -->

I am currently employed as a machine learning engineer the Applied Physics Laboratory (@ Johns Hopkins University). Much of my work has been within the autonomous system domain. More specifically building, designing and deploying deep learning solutions for perception/robotics tasks in the maritime domain. I've worked with several modalities including: EO/IR, LWIR/MWIR, sonar, and hyperspectral imagery. Perception work includes a fair amount of automatic target recognition involving object detection and segmentation. Much of my integration and deployment development work is done via C++ while the data processing and model training side is done in Python.
