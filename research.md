My primary research focus involves capturing higher-level semantic representations in visual and language to do useful tasks

**I created my own Github page primarily as a journal log to help mentally solidfy the nuances behind the many algorithms and architectures I read about.**

### Background

<!-- To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions. -->

I am currently employed as a full-time machine learning engineer the Applied Physics Laboratory (@ Johns Hopkins University). Much of my work has been within the autonomous system domain. More specifically building, designing and deploying deep learning solutions for perception/robotics efforts in the maritime domain. I've worked with several modalities including: EO/IR, LWIR/MWIR, sonar, and hyperspectral imagery. Perception work includes a fair amount of automatic target recognition involving object detection and segmentation. Much of my integration and deployment development work is done via C++ while the data processing and model training side is done in Python. One major perk of working at APL is their part-time student program, consequently I made the decision to pursue a PhD on the side at UMBC. Before APL, I was a ML software engineer at Northrop Grumman working with synthetic-aperature imagery (SAR).

### Frameworks

Software Languages: C/C#/C++, Python, and Java

ML Dev: Tensorflow (C++/Python), Pytorch (Python), Keras, OpenCV (C++/Python), ROS (C++/Python), NumPy, SciPy, HuggingFace, scikit-learn, TensorRT (C++/Python), Unity3D, probably other smaller scientific Python packages I had to pip install here and there.

ML Experience: Primarily deep learning in computer vision and natural language processing with some reinforcement learning sprinkled in there.

### Undergraduate Research

During my undergraduate days many years ago I worked with Dr. George Shoane on various projects involving ocular mechanics.

Below are the following publications from my research as a student researcher under Dr.Shoane:

**Drowsy Driver Mobile Application: Development of a novel scleral-area detection method**
