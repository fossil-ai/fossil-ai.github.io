My primary research focus involves capturing higher-level semantic representations in visual and language to do useful tasks. My currently focused task of interest is navigation and figuring how to encourage a sense of reasoning in an agent. I use the term 'reasoning' loosely here - however, my belief is that structured, heterogeneous and/or graphical input representations enable a stronger tie to how a human would process information. My target domain in navigation is visual-language navigation (VLN).     

### Undergraduate Research

During my undergraduate days many years ago I worked with Dr. George Shoane on various projects involving ocular mechanics. Below are the following publications from my research as a student researcher under Dr.Shoane:

**Drowsy Driver Mobile Application: Development of a novel scleral-area detection method**

**Eye Growth and Myopia Development: Unifying theory and Matlab Model**

**Timing Differences in Eye-Hand Coordination Between Experienced and Inexperienced Tennis Players**
